Can you solve this Angel One SQL interview question in less than 5 minutes?


For an airline company following are the ticket data points:

flight_number,
origin ,
destination,
oneway_round,
ticket_count

oneway_round ='O' -> One Way Trip
oneway_round ='R' -> Round Trip

Note: DEL -> BOM is a different route from BOM -> DEL

Write an SQL to identify the busiest route based on the total number of ticket count for each route.

CREATE TABLE tickets (
airline_number VARCHAR(10),
origin VARCHAR(3),
destination VARCHAR(3),
oneway_round CHAR(1),
ticket_count INT
);


INSERT INTO tickets (airline_number, origin, destination, oneway_round, ticket_count)
VALUES
('DEF456', 'BOM', 'DEL', 'O', 150),
('GHI789', 'DEL', 'BOM', 'R', 50),
('JKL012', 'BOM', 'DEL', 'R', 75),
('MNO345', 'DEL', 'NYC', 'O', 200),
('PQR678', 'NYC', 'DEL', 'O', 180),
('STU901', 'NYC', 'DEL', 'R', 60),
('ABC123', 'DEL', 'BOM', 'O', 100),
('VWX234', 'DEL', 'NYC', 'R', 90);


Expected output :

origin , destination , ticket_count
DEL , NYC , 350

My Solution:

With t1 as(select origin, destination , ticket_count
from tickets
union all
select destination as origin , origin as destination, ticket_count
from tickets
where oneway_round = R)
select origin , destination , sum(ticket_count)
as total tickets 
group by 1,2
order by sum(ticket_count) desc
limit 1
