Write a query to find workaholics employees.  Workaholics employees are those who satisfy atleast one of the given criterion:

1- Employees who work for more than 8 hours a day for atleast 3 days in a week. 

2- Employees who work for more than 10 hours a day for atleast 2 days in a week. 

You are given the login and logout timings of all the employess for a given week. Write a SQL to find all the workaholic employees along with the criterion that they are satisfying (1,2 or both).

Table: employees(primary key : emp_id ,login)

column name	data type 
emp_id 	int
login 	datetime
logout 	datetime

Example Output:

emp_id	criterian
100	1
200	2
300	both


My Solution

with crt as (
select emp_id 
, round((julianday(logout) - julianday(login)) * 24,2) AS hours_difference,
sum(case
    when round((julianday(logout) - julianday(login)) * 24,2)> 8 then 1 else 0 end) as crt1
, 
sum(case
    when round((julianday(logout) - julianday(login)) * 24,2)> 10 then 1 else 0 end) as crt2
from employees
group by emp_id)

select emp_id,
(case 
    when crt1>=3 and crt2>=2 then "both"
    when crt1>=3 and crt2<2 then 1
    when crt1<3 and crt2>=2 then 2
    end) as criterian
    from crt
    where crt1>=3 or crt2>=2
