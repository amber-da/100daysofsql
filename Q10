NamasteKart an ecommerce company wants to find out its top most selling product by quanity in each category. In case of a tie when quantities sold are same for more than 1 product than we need to give preference to the product with higher sales value.

Table: orders (primary key : order_id)

column name	datatype
order_id	int
product_id	varchar(20)
category	varchar(10)
unit_price	int
quantity	int
 
Expected Output: 

category	product_id
Footwear	floaters-3421
Furniture	Table-3421

Solution:

WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
        category,
        product_id,
        dense_rank() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY SUM(quantity) DESC, SUM(quantity * unit_price) DESC) AS rnk
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY category, product_id
)
SELECT category, product_id
FROM cte
WHERE rnk = 1;
