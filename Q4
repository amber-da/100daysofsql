LinkedIn is a professional social networking app. They want to give top voice badge to their best creators to encourage them to create more quality content. A creator qualifies for the badge if he/she satisfies following criteria. 

1- Creator should have more then 50k followers.

2- Creator should have more than 100k impressions on the posts that they published in the month of Dec-2023.

3- Creator should have published atleast 3 posts in Dec-2023.

Write a SQL to get the list of top voice creators name along with no of posts and impressions by them in the month of Dec-2023.

Table: creators(primary key : creator_id)

column name	data type 
creator_id 	int
creator_name 	varchar(20)
followers 	int
 

Table: posts(primary key : post_id)

column name	data type 
creator_id 	int
post_id 	varchar(3)
publish_date 	date
impressions 	int
 

Example output:

creator_name	no_of_posts	 total_impressions
Ankit Bansal	3	132000
 


Solution

select 
creator_name,
count(post_id) as no_of_posts,
sum(impressions) as total_impressions
from posts p
join creators c on c.creator_id = p.creator_id
where strftime('%Y-%m',publish_date) = "2023-12" and followers>50000
group by creator_name
having count(post_id) >= 3 and sum(impressions) > 100000
