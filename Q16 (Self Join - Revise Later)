Product recommendation. Just the basic type (“customers who bought this also bought…”). That, in its simplest form, is an outcome of basket analysis. Write a SQL to find the product pairs along with the count of times they have been purchased together. Based on the history ecommerce website can recommend products to new user.

Table: orders (primary key : order_id)

column name	datatype
order_id	int
customer_id 	int
product_id 	varchar(2)

Expected Output:

product_1	product_2	purchase_frequency
p2	p1	2
p3	p1	1
p3	p2	1
p4	p1	1
p4	p2	1
Note : In the output product_1 values should be greater than product_2 values. eg: pair p1,p2 or p2,p1 represent same thing but we need to show p2,p1 in the output.

My_Solution

select o1.product_id as product_1,
o2.product_id as product_2,
count(*) as purchase_frequency
from orders o1
join orders o2
on o1.order_id = o2.order_id
where o1.product_id>o2.product_id
group by o1.product_id, o2.product_id
