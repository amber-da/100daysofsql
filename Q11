NamasteKart an ecommerce company wants to build a very imporant business metrics where they want to track on daily basis how many new and repeat customers are purchasing products from their website. A new customer is defined when he purchased anything for the first time from the website and repeat customer is someone who has done atleast one purchase in the past.

Table: customer_orders (primary key : order_id)

column name	datatype
order_id	int
order_date	date
customer_id 	int
order_amount 	int
 
Expected Output:

order_date	new_customers	repeat_customers
2022-01-01	3	0
2022-01-02	2	1
2022-01-03	1	2

My Solution:

with rnk as (select 
order_date,
customer_id,
dense_rank() over (partition by customer_id order by order_date ) as rnk 

from customer_orders)

select
order_date,
sum(case when rnk = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as new_customers,
sum(case when rnk <> 1 then 1 else 0 end) as repeat_customers

from rnk 
group by order_date
